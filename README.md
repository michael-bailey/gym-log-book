# Gym Log Book
An app, developed to assist me in my tracking my progress, at the gym.
As well as being a scratch pad to, tests new user interface designs, and experiment with app architectures.

## Goals
- Reliably track, aggregate, and display my progress at the gym
- Brainstorm architecture patterns that can resolve issues in other projects.

## Future Goals
- practice data science, by combining my results, and using that to create suggestions for workouts and session planning
- add scriptability to introspect and modify data on the fly.

> This app can be unstable, as it can change rapidly
